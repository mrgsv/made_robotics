    "In this homework assignment, we will implement an algorithm for estimating the robot's pose known as a particle filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particle filter consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The movement of particles in accordance with the kinematic motion model. The movement is carried out using the probabilistic motion function, taking into account the randomness of the process (noise of the motion).\n",
    "2. Comparison of the obtained measurement with the expected one by applying a probabilistic measurement function that estimates the probability of the obtained measurement given a fixed position of the particle. As a result of this step, each particle is assigned a weight proportional to the likelihood of the measurement given the position of the particle.\n",
    "3. Resampling is a process in which the probability of a particle to be chosen for a new set is proportional to the weight (likelihood) of the particle.\n",

    "## Task 1\n",
    " \n",
    "Implement the motion model of the mobile robot $p(x_ {t + 1} | x_t, u_t)$ as part of the `Robot` class. The method must be named `move`. The `move` method takes as input the current position of the robot and a vector of control signals (the steering angle ($\\alpha$) and the distance the robot should move ($d$)). The `move` method must return an instance of the `Robot` class with a new state vector $(x, y, \\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework assignment, we will assume that our robot has car-like kinematics. Such kinematics is described by the [bicycle model](https://nabinsharma.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/kinematics-of-a-robot-bicycle-model/) (you can also refer to Lecture 3. The tricycle (note the difference in the notation). You need to implement a bicycle model in the `move()` method as an approximation of car-like kinematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The coordinates $(x, y)$ of the robot's state vector set the position of the center of the rear wheel axle of the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The `move` method must also simulate the noise of the control signals. For this, additive normal noise is applied to each component of the control signal vector. The steering angle noise is specified by the `Robot.steering_noise` class attribute. The movement noise is specified by the `Robot.distance_noise` class attribute. The `Robot.steering_noise` and `Robot.distance_noise` parameters set the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of the normal distribution."

The `measurement_prob` method takes a measurement vector $z$ as input and returns the likelihood of the measurement. Likelihood is calculated as the product of four (by the number of landmarks) normal distributions of measurement errors. Each normal distribution shows the bearing probability i.e. the normal distribution of the error for each bearing has the mathematical expectation in the true (expected) bearing value and the variance given by the `Robot.bearing_noise` parameter.\n",
